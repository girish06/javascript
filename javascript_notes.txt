computer program is a list of instructions and these instructions are called as statements.

These statements can be variables,expressions,operators,keywords and comments

statements always have keywords which js understand that to execute.


JS Syntax:
++++++++++++++++


Js defines two type of values
1. literals - which are fixed values
2. varibles - variable values are called are variables

varibles used to store the values.
javascript uses var keyword to declare the variables.
Equal sign is used to assign the values to the variables.	


Js operators
+,-,*,/

JS expressions
   Its a combination of values,varibles,operatores which computes the values.

JS keywords:
 eg. var

JS Comments:

 double slash is a comment
 statements enclosed within /** and */ 

JS identifiers:

used to name varibles with rules 

 -> should not start with number
 -> can start with underscore
 -> cannot be any javascript reserved keywords.
 -> can be dollar sign.


JS case sensitive:
  ->js doesnot interpret Var or VAR,since it evalutes only  var.
 
JS Camel case:
Hypens:
   not allowed since it is a reserved keyword for subtraction.
underscore
   use underscorer to get combine two different words
upper camle case (pascal case):
  first letter of each word can be start with uppercase.
