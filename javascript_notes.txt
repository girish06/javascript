JS Arthimetic:
+++++++++++++++

JS Arthimetic Operators:
 -> arthimetic operations
 -> operands and operators

  1. Add
  2. sub
  3. mul
  4. div
  5. remainder
  6. increment operator
  7. Decrement operator
  8. exponential
  9. Math.pow
  10.operator precedence
    -> higher precedence have for brackets
    -> then for operators for mul and div
    -> then for addition and substraction
    -> if no brackets are there then its execution will be from left to right.

JS stateMents:
+++++++++++++++

computer program is a list of instructions and these instructions are called as statements.

These statements can be variables,expressions,operators,keywords and comments

add a semicolon at the end of the statement.

Its is always good to break the code after the operators when it exceeds 80 characters.

statements always have keywords which js understand that to execute.


JS Syntax:
++++++++++++++++

Js defines two type of values
1. literals - which are fixed values
2. varibles - variable values are called are variables

JS Literals:
 numbers can be with or without decimal
 strings are enclosed with single or double quotes.

Js varibles:

varibles used to store the values.
javascript uses var keyword to declare the variables.
Equal sign is used to assign the values to the variables.	


Js operators
+,-,*,/

JS expressions
   Its a combination of values,varibles,operatores which computes the values.

JS keywords:
 eg. var

JS Comments:

 double slash is a comment
 statements enclosed within /** and */ 

JS identifiers:

used to name varibles with rules 

 -> should not start with number
 -> can start with underscore
 -> cannot be any javascript reserved keywords.
 -> can be dollar sign.


JS case sensitive:
  ->js doesnot interpret Var or VAR,since it evalutes only  var.
 
JS Camel case:
Hypens:
   not allowed since it is a reserved keyword for subtraction.
underscore
   use underscorer to get combine two different words
upper camle case (pascal case):
  first letter of each word can be start with uppercase.
lower caml case:
  second word first character should be uppercase.

JS character set:
 ->javascript follows unicode character set.

JS COMMENTS:
++++++++++++

single line comment
multiline comment

JS Variables: 
+++++++++++++

Js identifiers:(already done)

Js Assignment operator ( = ) and equal to operator is different(==)

Js Datatypes: 

Js declaring or creating variables
  can declare a variable using the keyword  var
  if the variable is not assigned with any value then technically it has the value undefined.

Js one statement,many variables.

Js value undefined
   Declared a variable but it doesn,t have any value then the it throws error as undefined.

Js redeclaring the variables.
   it will lose it value.

Js arthimetic:


Js Operators:
+++++++++++++

Js Assignment operator

=   :  x = y   : x = y
+=  :  x += y  : x = x + y
-=  :  x -= y  : x = x - y 
*=  :  x *= y  : x = x * y
/=  :  x /= y  : x = x / y
%=  :  x %= y  : x = x % y
**= :  x **= y : x = x ** y


Js string operator

Js strings and numbers

Js comparision operator

==   : equal too
===  : equal too and equal type
!=   : not equal too
!==  : not equal too not equal type
>    : greater than
<    : lesser than
>=   : greater than or equal too
<=   : lesser than or equal too
?    : ternary operator

Js logical operator:

&& : logical AND
|| : logical OR
!  : logical NOT

Js type operators:

 -> typeof
     returns the type of the variable
 -> instanceof
     returns true if an object is an instance of object type.

Js bitwise operator: // needs work and needs understanding
  &
  |
  ~
  ^
  << 
  >>
  >>

JS outputs:
+++++++++++++

Javascript display possibilties.

1. writing into html element using ,  innerHTML.
2. writing into html output using, document.write().
