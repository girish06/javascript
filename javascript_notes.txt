JS Functions:
+++++++++++++

Js functions are block of code to perform a task.
Js functions are executed when in invoked or called.

  syntax:
   
  javascript function is defined by "function" keyword followed by name and followed by parentheses ().
  function name can contains which had the rules of similar to variables.
  parenthesis can contains parameters seperated by comma.
  The code has to be executed should be inside the curly braces {}.
  Function arguments are the values received by the function when its called.
  Inside the function the arguments behave like local variables.

 function invocation:
  
   The code inside the function is executed when it is called or invoked.
    -> when an event accours eg . on click of button
    -> when it is invoked in js code.
    -> automatically invoked. // needs to check

  Function return:
    
   After the return function will stop executing.
   
  why functions?
  
   Resuabilty.
   we can same function with different parametes to get different output.


JS Objects:
+++++++++++++++

javascript objects are like variables, but it holds many values
values in the format of name value pair seperated by colon.

  Js properties:
   name value pair in an object are called js properties.
  
    Accessing the properties:
      we can access the properties in two different ways

      1. objectname.propertyname
      2. objectname["propertyname"]
  
  Js methods:
 
   Object also can have methods	
   Methods are action that can be performed in objects
   Methods are stored in object properties as a function definition.

  Js this keyword:

    This keyword refers to the owner of the function.
  
  Accessing the function.
    we can access the properties and  method of object.

    syntax: 
         objectname.methodname().
    Note. we are not using the parentheses then it will return the function definition.


JS Events:
+++++++++++

Html events are the one that happen to html elements
when javascript used on the html page, they can react on those html elements.

 Html elements:
  html events are detected and js events perform actions on it.
 
 what javascript can do.
  1. can do changes once the page is loaded 
  2. can do changes once the page is  closed
  3. click  event to perform some action
  4. can validate the user input.
  5. HTML events can execute the js code directly.
  6. HTML events can call the js function directly.

JS Strings:
++++++++++++
   JS strings:
     strings must be enclosed with single quotes or double quotes.
     we can use quotes inside the string unless it matches the surrounding string.
   
   string length:
     var.length 
 
  
   special characters:
     \' for quotes

   breaking long line of code.
     If code is exceeding 80 characters long the good way to break the line at the operator.
     we can break the code using \ between strings , but it was supoorted universally 
     The best way to break the string by concat operator.
     
   string can be objects.
     variables can be defined as object with "new" keyword
     NOTE: dont create strings as object since	it slows down the execution time,  and might with new keyword will 
            produce unexcepted result

JS Assignment
+++++++++++++
Already completed the excercise.

JS Datatype:
+++++++++++++

-> js variables hold various datatype like number,string and object.
   

 js types are dynamic
   same variable can hold different data types. may be it can be undefined, number, string , object

 js strings
   string is a series of characters 
   string can be enlclosed with double quotes or single quotes.
 
 js numbers.
   js has only one type of number
   number can be with or without decimals
    
   extra large or extra small can be exposed with scientific (exponential)notation

 js booleans:
   can be true of false
    boolean are often used in conditional testing.

 js arrays:
   arrays are enclosed by square brackets
   array item are seperated by commas.
   array index value starts from 0.
 
 js objects:
    javascript objects are written with curly braces {}.
    object properties are written in key value pair seperated by commas.

 js typeof operator:
     returns the type of variable

 js undefined
   if the varible is defined and the variable does not have any value then its is undefined and its type also undefined.
   we can make the variable as emptied if we assign the value as undefined to the variable.

 js empty value
   	
 js null value:
     in javascript the data typeof of null is a object.
     we can empty the object by setting it as null

 js diff between undefined and null.
     undefined and null are equal in value but they are different in datatype.

 js primitive datatypes:
     single simple data value.
     It does not contains properties and methods
        typeof 	operator can return 
            -> number 
            -> string
            -> undefined
            -> boolean

 js complex data type.
      type of operator will return object ,function 
      typeof operator will return as object for arrays , null  and object.
      in javascripts arrays are objects

JS Arthimetic:
+++++++++++++++

JS Arthimetic Operators:
 -> arthimetic operations
 -> operands and operators

  1. Add
  2. sub
  3. mul
  4. div
  5. remainder
  6. increment operator
  7. Decrement operator
  8. exponential
  9. Math.pow
  10.operator precedence
    -> higher precedence have for brackets
    -> then for operators for mul and div
    -> then for addition and substraction
    -> if no brackets are there then its execution will be from left to right.

JS stateMents:
+++++++++++++++

computer program is a list of instructions and these instructions are called as statements.

These statements can be variables,expressions,operators,keywords and comments

add a semicolon at the end of the statement.

Its is always good to break the code after the operators when it exceeds 80 characters.

statements always have keywords which js understand that to execute.


JS Syntax:
++++++++++++++++

Js defines two type of values
1. literals - which are fixed values
2. varibles - variable values are called are variables

JS Literals:
 numbers can be with or without decimal
 strings are enclosed with single or double quotes.

Js varibles:

varibles used to store the values.
javascript uses var keyword to declare the variables.
Equal sign is used to assign the values to the variables.	


Js operators
+,-,*,/

JS expressions
   Its a combination of values,varibles,operatores which computes the values.

JS keywords:
 eg. var

JS Comments:

 double slash is a comment
 statements enclosed within /** and */ 

JS identifiers:

used to name varibles with rules 

 -> should not start with number
 -> can start with underscore
 -> cannot be any javascript reserved keywords.
 -> can be dollar sign.


JS case sensitive:
  ->js doesnot interpret Var or VAR,since it evalutes only  var.
 
JS Camel case:
Hypens:
   not allowed since it is a reserved keyword for subtraction.
underscore
   use underscorer to get combine two different words
upper camle case (pascal case):
  first letter of each word can be start with uppercase.
lower caml case:
  second word first character should be uppercase.

JS character set:
 ->javascript follows unicode character set.

JS COMMENTS:
++++++++++++

single line comment
multiline comment

JS Variables: 
+++++++++++++

Js identifiers:(already done)

Js Assignment operator ( = ) and equal to operator is different(==)

Js Datatypes: 

Js declaring or creating variables
  can declare a variable using the keyword  var
  if the variable is not assigned with any value then technically it has the value undefined.

Js one statement,many variables.

Js value undefined
   Declared a variable but it doesn,t have any value then the it throws error as undefined.

Js redeclaring the variables.
   it will lose it value.

Js arthimetic:


Js Operators:
+++++++++++++

Js Assignment operator

=   :  x = y   : x = y
+=  :  x += y  : x = x + y
-=  :  x -= y  : x = x - y 
*=  :  x *= y  : x = x * y
/=  :  x /= y  : x = x / y
%=  :  x %= y  : x = x % y
**= :  x **= y : x = x ** y


Js string operator

Js strings and numbers

Js comparision operator

==   : equal too
===  : equal too and equal type
!=   : not equal too
!==  : not equal too not equal type
>    : greater than
<    : lesser than
>=   : greater than or equal too
<=   : lesser than or equal too
?    : ternary operator

Js logical operator:

&& : logical AND
|| : logical OR
!  : logical NOT

Js type operators:

 -> typeof
     returns the type of the variable
 -> instanceof
     returns true if an object is an instance of object type.

Js bitwise operator: // needs work and needs understanding
  &
  |
  ~
  ^
  << 
  >>
  >>

JS Home:
+++++++++++++

programming language of html and web
Behaviour of web pages
Many  desktop and server programmer use javascript
Some databases use javascript as their programming language.

History:

Introduced by brendan Eich in 1995.


JS Intro:
+++++++++++++

1.can change html content
  JS use getElementById method to get the element refered
  we can use double quotes or single quotes.

2. can change html attributes
    eg.  img attributes
    document.getElementById("imgid").src 
 
3. can change html style css
4. can hide html elements
5. Can show html elements

JS where to
+++++++++++++
In html javascript should be embedded in script tag.
java script function is a block of code executed when its called.
scripts can be placed in head tag or body tag or in both.

External script

External javascript advantages.
 -> seperates the html and js code
 -> easier to maintain html and js code.
 -> cached js file result in to speed up the pages.

External javasccript file must be specified with full path.

JS outputs:
+++++++++++++

Javascript display possibilties.

1. writing into html element using ,  innerHTML.
2. writing into html output using, document.write().
     Note:  Never  call the document.write after the document finished loading. it will overwrite the whole document
            should be used only for testing.
3. writing into alert box , usig window.alert().

4. writing into browser console,using conosle.log().
